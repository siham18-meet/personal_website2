<p> Q: How to not be a dissapointement? </p>
<p> A: most parents have a definite perception and high expectation from their children and when the child sways away from their wishes their high hopes are not realised they begin to vent their anger or frustration by making the child feel they are not good enough for them but on the other side to be fair to the parents they are expected to produce highly successful children from their peers and society and the child's failure makes them feel they have failed too and end up beating themselves too hard and of course making the child the butt of their anger</p>
